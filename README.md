# DistanceControl
A brief code with a control with odometry message.
In this project you will found a rospackage in charge of the control distance that can move a mobile robot according with
a /odom topic in the mobile robot. You just change the subscriber topic  "/odom" by a topic that your robot has e.g. "/mobile_base/odom".
If you have any problem with that please send me a email -> luis_camara_salinas@hotmail.com.
